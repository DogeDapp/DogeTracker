## Hey, you have been a good boy!

Well, thank you! 

I've created this app because I could not find an app that I liked (or was still supported) on the app store. I just wanted an app to keep track of multiple address and the current exchange rates. Not something that just creates new addresses and/or has my private keys. I am a computer science grad student and wanted to take a look at iOS development for quite some time, but I never found something that wasn't already on the app store. So this time I was out of excuses and luckily got some spare time during my winter break. Of course the love of the Dogecoin community on reddit gave the final push to realize this project. That said, it took me quite some amount of work to implement this app. So if you want to throw me a bone here is my Dogecoin address:
